On November 5th, in Paris, was held the [Elastic{ON}](https://www.elastic.co/elasticon) 2015, the conference made by
Elastic to keep in touch with the Elastic users. In the middle of the Bois de Boulogne, at the Pavillon d'Armenoville,
Elastic set up a stage where different figures of the company came to talk about the future of Elastic's products.

# In the morning: "Product Deep Dive and Roadmap"

The festivities began with this very first conference, held in the late morning, for Elastic's staff to talk about
the future of their main products: Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana (the famous ELK stack).

First, as an introduction, the master of ceremony introduced a number: 15 035. This, in dollar, is the amount of money
that will be given to a french association, ["Docteur Souris"](www.docteursouris.fr) (computer mouse doctor, Ed). In
a few words, this association helps the hospitalized children to keep in touch with their family, and to keep going
with their studies. Also, "Docteur Souris" was looking for Elasticsearch experts to work as volunteer on their projects.

Right after, the creator and CTO of Elastic himself, Shay Banon, get on the stage, to introduce us the Elastic{ON} Paris
2015. He decided to tell us how, when his wife decided to become a Chef, he had the idea to create a cooking
application. His idea was to simply have a search bar, where his wife could simply type the name of a dish, or an
ingredient, and get detailed information about it. At that time, the few available APIs where really low-level,
and he decided to build an abstraction layer on top of it. Elasticsearch was born. Fun facts, when he released the
first version of Elasticsearch (still in development), Shay Banon decided to tag it has the version 0.4, unstead of
0.1, to give credit to his product.

And so came some more numbers. 35 000 is the total number of users whom are part of the Elastic community. Elastic
has nearly 120 user groups, spread around the world's biggest cities. All projects of the ELK stacks put together
count more than 32 000 commits! Until now, Elasticsearch has been downloaded more than 35 million times!

Then began the list of the most biggest organization and companies. Wikimedia foundation (creator of Wikipedia) is
having a transition to work on Elasticsearch. Also, Mozilla is using the ELK stack on their security tool, named as
MozDef. The NASA also use the ELK stack to collect and analyze data from martian rovers.

Finally, Shay Banon told us about a funny fact, his first customer on Elastic's IRC channel, Clinton Gormley. As Shay
was dreaming of his first customer to work with Elasticsearch with "sexy" languages, on amazing project,
here came Clinton, working on a project about funerals, with Perl. As the time goes, Clinton became an priceless member
of Elasticsearch community, and nowadays, he works for Elastic.
