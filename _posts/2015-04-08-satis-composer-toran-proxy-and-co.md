> OK, you use Composer along with packagist... But how actually?

In those slides, I try to show you why and how you should use Satis (or Toran-Proxy if possible) to handle your private
repositories AND secure your development and production environments for the public repositories you depend on.

This particular topic and its importance, while already widely covered, is often under-estimated by small to mid teams,
focusing first on features adding and improvements.
