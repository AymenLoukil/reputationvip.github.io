At Reputation VIP, we regularly organize internal technical presentations and reviews.
It's the ideal moment for us to grow our skills and to share them across our entire team.

In January, 2016, we had two great presentations:

- A demo combining Ionic Framework and Google Cast by [Thomas](https://twitter.com/tomalelievre)
- An introduction to Flexbox by [Snapeuh](https://twitter.com/snapeuh)

You can see the great Thomas' Ionic / Google Cast slides here:

Flexbox introduction was quite awesome too. You can find the slides below:
