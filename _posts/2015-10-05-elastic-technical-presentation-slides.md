At Reputation VIP, we organize regularly internal technical presentations and reviews. It's the ideal moment for us to grow our skills and to share them accros our entire team.

Last week, on thursday, Quentin (https://twitter.com/limonpies) gave us an awesome presentation about Elastic Search.

Of course, nowadays, everyone has heard of the great tool it is but, internally at Reputation VIP, just a few of us gave it a real try. Quentin is quite passionate about Elastic and is working since a few months now on a serie of articles about its products and ecosystem.

Two of them have already been published on this very same blog. If you are interested in the subject, give it a, non so quick, look (~20K words at least!) here: http://reputationvip.io/elasticsearch-is-coming/ and here: http://reputationvip.io/elasticsearch-always-pays-its-debts/

And, as a gift, here are the great slides Quentin show us last week :
